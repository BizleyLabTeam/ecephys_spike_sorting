TPrime Helper
==============
Python wrapper for TPrime, a C++ command line application for mapping times between data streams collected by SpikeGLX. Each stream must have a common sync signal, and the edge times from that sync signal must be extracted by CatGT. See the README for TPrime for details about parameters.

Dependencies
------------
[TPrime](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/)

Running
-------
```
python -m ecephys_spike_sorting.modules.TPrime_helper--input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
Two arguments must be included:
1. The location of an existing file in JSON format containing a list of paths and parameters.
2. The location to write a file in JSON format containing information generated by the module while it was run.

See the `_schemas.py` file for detailed information about the contents of the input JSON.

TPrime Helper parses toStream_sync_params to find the SYNC file, assuming the data has been saved and processed through CatGT using probe folders. So, a file of sync edges from a probe is expected to be in the probe folder:
catgt_<run name>_g<gate>\<run name>_g<gate>_imec<probe index>\

spike_times.npy files for all probes for which there are sync edge files are read in and translated to seconds using the sample rate stored in params.py. (Note: the sample rate written out by rezToPhy is replaced by a higher precision value in the kilosort_helper module).

The CatGT command line is parsed:

All SY extracted(except toStream)are designated fromstreams

For all probes not specified as the toStream, the file <probe_folder>\imecN_ks2\spike_times_sec.txt are designated events files

If tostream is not XA or XD, niStream_sync is designated a fromstream

All XA and XD extracted which are not specified as the the toStream or the niStream_sync are designated events files

These parameters are used to build the TPrime command line.

After running TPrime, the output times are resaved in npy format, as floats.

Notes:
- Since auxiliary data is usually collected at lower sample rates, a probe should be selected as the reference tostream

- Stated above, but worth repeating: this helper module assumes data stored in the probe folder format, with phy output written to <probe_folder>\imecN_ks2

Parameters
----------
- sync_period : in seconds, = 1.0 for sync generated by NP basestation
- toStream_sync_params : specify sync edges for tostream
- niStream_sync_params : specify sync edges for ni stream 

Input data
----------
- **CatGT extracted edge files for sync and events** : text files generated by CatGT with sync event edge times, in sec.
- **spike_times.npy files** : for each probe

Output data
-----------
- **spike_times_adj.txt, spike_times_adj.npy** : text files of spike times for each from stream
