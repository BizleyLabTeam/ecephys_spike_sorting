Kilosort Helper
==============
Python wrapper for pyks2, python spike sorting with Kilosort.

This module auto-generates the Probe Bunch (reading data from the SpikeGLX metadata file), and the Param Bunch (from the variables in teh schema; these can be edited in create_input_json.py). The code has been specifically tailored to the Janelia fork of the IBL version of pyks2.

Dependencies
------------
[Kilosort](https://github.com/jenniferColonell/pykilosort) - See the readme for requirements, currently only tested with Scientific Linux 

Running
-------
```
python -m ecephys_spike_sorting.modules.pyks2_helper --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
Two arguments must be included:
1. The location of an existing file in JSON format containing a list of paths and parameters.
2. The location to write a file in JSON format containing information generated by the module while it was run.

See the `_schemas.py` file for detailed information about the contents of the input JSON.

Input data
----------
- **AP band .dat or .bin file** : int16 binary files written by [Open Ephys](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI), [SpikeGLX](https://github.com/billkarsh/spikeglx), or the `extract_from_npx` module.

Output data
-----------
- **Kilosort output files** : .npy files containing spike times, cluster labels, templates, etc. These are the input for phy.
